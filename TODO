- fix blank lines at start of latex output

something to do with template? it isn't pandoc.

- set figure names to something more descriptive

We will need to use a custom pre-processor. The filename is currently set by
`IPython.nbconvert.preprocessors.extractoutput.ExtractOutputPreprocessor.output_filename_template`

See nbconvert-examples/custom_preprocessor for an example.

- create custom markdown template that lets us export from notebook to markdown
  with fenced code blocks and no outputs, like we would write for use with
  notedown.

  use case: write markdown and convert to notebook with notedown. fiddle about
  in the notebook and save changes. convert back to markdown with the changes
  saved.

  differences from normal markdown output: fenced code blocks; discard all
  outputs (your code should be reproducible!)
